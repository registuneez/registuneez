Some people have a shelf full of books. I have a shelf full of participation
trophies. You can tell who the real intellectual is here.😎

I may not speak the language of love 💔, but I do speak
the language of bugs - I'm a software developer👨‍💻who works
with languages like :
🔸html5 logo 🔸css3 🔸logo 🔸javascript logo 🔸react logo 🔸mysql logo 🔸postgresql logo 🔸php logo
🔸ruby logo 🔸rails logo 🔸sass logo 🔸tailwindcss logo 🔸c logo 🔸cplusplus logo 🔸bootstrap logo


My computer screen 💻 is a funny thing, it's a love-hate relationship. While it's full 🌝
of code and possibilities, I keep trying to find a picture of a beach to use as my
background, but all I ever see is 'beach.js'. I'm a master of creating websites 🌐 that
look great on any screen... except mine, and if you think my screen
is full of code now, you should have seen it before I cleaned it up! 😋



✨✨Let's join forces like Batman and Robin, or like peanut
butter and jelly. We'll make an unstoppable duo.✨✨✨
